#' @title QUILT_HLA_prepare_reference
#' @param outputdir What output directory to use
#' @param nGen Number of generations since founding or mixing. Note that the algorithm is relatively robust to this. Use nGen = 4 * Ne / K if unsure, where K is number of haplotypes.
#' @param hla_types_panel Path to file with 1000 Genomes formatted HLA types (see example for format details)
#' @param ipd_igmt_alignments_zip_file Path to zip file with alignments from IPD-IGMT (see README and example for more details)
#' @param ref_fasta Path to reference genome fasta 
#' @param refseq_table_file Path to file with UCSC refseq gene information (see README and example for more details)
#' @param full_regionStart When building HLA full reference panel, start of maximal region spanning all HLA genes. The 1-based position x is kept if regionStart <= x <= regionEnd
#' @param full_regionEnd As above, but end of maximal region spanning all HLA genes
#' @param buffer Buffer of region to perform imputation over. So imputation is run form regionStart-buffer to regionEnd+buffer, and reported for regionStart to regionEnd, including the bases of regionStart and regionEnd
#' @param region_exclude_file File with regions to exclude from constructing the reference panel. Particularly useful for QUILT_HLA, where you want to exclude SNPs in the HLA genes themselves, so that reads contribute either to the read mapping or state inference. This file is space separated with a header of Name, Chr, Start and End, with Name being the HLA gene name (e.g. HLA-A), Chr being the chromosome (e.g. chr6), and Start and End are the 1-based starts and ends of the genes (i.e. where we don't want to consider SNPs for the Gibbs sampling state inference)
#' @param genetic_map_file Path to file with genetic map information, a file with 3 white-space delimited entries giving position (1-based), genetic rate map in cM/Mbp, and genetic map in cM. If no file included, rate is based on physical distance and expected rate (expRate)
#' @param reference_haplotype_file Path to reference haplotype file in IMPUTE format (file with no header and no rownames, one row per SNP, one column per reference haplotype, space separated, values must be 0 or 1)
#' @param reference_legend_file Path to reference haplotype legend file in IMPUTE format (file with one row per SNP, and a header including position for the physical position in 1 based coordinates, a0 for the reference allele, and a1 for the alternate allele)
#' @param reference_sample_file Path to reference sample file (file with header, one must be POP, corresponding to populations that can be specified using reference_populations)
#' @param reference_exclude_samplelist_file File with one column of samples to exclude from final reference panels. These samples can be removed at one of two points, depending on reference_exclude_samples_for_initial_phasing. If reference_exclude_samples_for_initial_phasing is FALSE, then these samples, if present, are used for the initial phasing and allele assignment. If TRUE, then they are removed immediately
#' @param reference_exclude_samples_for_initial_phasing See help for reference_exclude_samplelist_file
#' @param all_hla_regions Character vector of all HLA genes for which IPD-IMGT files are available for 
#' @param hla_regions_to_prepare Character vector of HLA genes to prepare for imputation
#' @param chr What chromosome to run (probably chr6 or similar)
#' @param minRate Minimum recomb rate cM/Mb
#' @param nCores How many cores to use
#' @return Results in properly formatted version
